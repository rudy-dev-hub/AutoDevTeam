## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rudy-dev-hub/AutoDevTeam.git
cd auto-dev-team
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up environment variables:
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Usage

1. Start the Streamlit app:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

2. Open your browser and navigate to the provided URL (typically http://localhost:8501)

3. Enter your task in the text input field and click "Submit Task"

4. The AI team will:
   - Break down the task into steps
   - Implement the solution
   - Review the code
   - Generate tests

5. The results will be displayed in the UI and saved to the `outputs` directory
